**user**: If a lead ball and a feather are dropped simultaneously from the same height, which will reach the ground first?

**ai**: In the absence of air resistance, both the lead ball and the feather will reach the ground at the same time. This is because, in a vacuum, all objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass due to gravity. However, in the presence of air resistance, the lead ball will reach the ground first because the feather experiences more air resistance relative to its weight, which slows it down significantly.
