## Page Notes
## Highlights
- I’ve identified four types of flywheels that occur frequently in mental health tech:Shared economies of scale. For example, when a mental health company invests in technology to lower the marginal cost of care. If the lower cost is passed on to patients in the form of lower prices, it attracts more patients, which drives down per patient costs even further.Network effects. For example, when two-sided marketplaces are built to match therapists with patients. More patients attract more therapists, which attracts even more patients.Brand habit. For example, when a digital therapeutic becomes associated with the treatment of a specific diagnosis, that therapeutic is more likely to be recommended by healthcare providers and used by patients, which strengthens the association even further.Switching costs. For example, when a product gets integrated into a health system’s electronic health record (EHR), it becomes costly for those health systems to switch to another vendor. This reduces competition, making it easier for the existing vendor to upsell and cross-sell new products to the health system. — [Updated on 2022-06-13 14:37:53](https://hyp.is/-JXpQuraEeyK82erEF8MjA/blog.limbix.com/flywheels-in-mental-health-tech-2d3e6dbf65e8) — Group: #Public
