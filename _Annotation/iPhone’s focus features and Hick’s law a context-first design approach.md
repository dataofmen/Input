## Highlights
- ConclusionTake note of your surroundings, and you’ll see just how many everyday interactions provide a streamlined experience based on context, removing options, and guiding the user.In March 2021, Google Chrome revamped their profile experience, noting that Chrome will prompt you to switch profiles “when you might benefit.”The iPhone provides “10 minutes to home” based on user patterns when a car connection is detected, without any setup or interaction.Adobe XD recently started displaying efficiency tooltips that match a user’s actions and steps taken at that moment.Spotify opens when headphones are paired.Car headlights turn on when dark, windshield wipers start with rain. Thinking and decisions are removed entirely while remaining accessible and adjustable. — [Updated on 2022-02-11 12:44:19](https://hyp.is/5N43BIrsEeywPjdh4ZIy5Q/uxdesign.cc/iphones-focus-features-and-hick-s-law-a-context-first-design-approach-d99b6ae2bdde) — Group: #Public
