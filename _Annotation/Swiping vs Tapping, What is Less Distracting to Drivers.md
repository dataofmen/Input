## Page Notes
## Highlights
- High cognitive load driving Driver distraction This experiment produced similar results as the previous, but with interesting developments. Under pressure, I completed each task quicker. But the biggest improvement was for the regular buttons. The mean task completion time was 1,3s versus the 1,7s of the previous experiment. Interestingly, I didn't see the same improvement in eyes-off-road time. So I performed the physical action of moving my finger to the screen and back quicker. But I still had to glance at the screen for as long as under normal conditions. In 4 instances, I first looked at the screen, moved my eyes back to the road, and then performed the action. I suspect that under pressure; I wanted to verify the position of the button before reaching out to it. This did not happen for swipes and large buttons. During the two runs with the normal buttons, I made 2 to 3 mistakes where I clicked next to the skip song button. — [Updated on 2022-02-18 10:41:51](https://hyp.is/8iBWJpBbEeyvQXM0AFXXyg/theturnsignalblog.com/blog/tap-vs-swipe/?ref=sidebar) — Group: #Public

운전 중 인터페이스 조작에 대한 연구는 자율주행이 완성되기 전까지는 필요한 연구이긴하다.
