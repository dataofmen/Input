## Page Notes
## Highlights
- Methodology Between August 13 - 18, 2021, we surveyed 667 iPhone users to measure their awareness of their daily screen time. We asked respondents to guess how much time they spend on their phones on a typical day, how often they pick up their phones, and what apps they use the most. Then we asked respondents to upload screenshots from their iOS Screen Time dashboard, so we could check their guesses against their averages for the previous seven days. Our respondents were 56 percent female and 44 percent male, between the ages of 18 to 68, with an average age of 35 years old.
