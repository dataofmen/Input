## Highlights
- To calculate the raw component scores, average your scores for each category. For the loyalty category, divide your score for the NPS question by 2 to convert to the same Likert scale before finding the average for the category. To calculate your raw SUPR-Q score, simply find the average of the component scores. Your result will be a score from 1-5 for each category, as well as a 1-5 total SUPR-Q score. — [Updated on 2021-04-19 14:19:52](https://hyp.is/3om51qDOEeuWW-tZz7N1Eg/fuzzymath.com/blog/suprq-design-metric/) — Group: #Public
