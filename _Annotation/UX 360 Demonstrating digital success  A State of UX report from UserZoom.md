## Page Notes
## Highlights
- ConclusionAlthough UX research has been growing in critical importance for organizations committed to digital transformation over the past couple of years, there’s no doubt the current pandemic has accelerated the necessity for research to become an integral part of digital strategy. Demands from internet users and traditionally ‘offline’ consumers have skyrocketed; UX teams need to match them or lose to an organization that does.The bottom line is that UX isn't just something for researchers to care about. Digital transformation means that UX is a business critical component of every digital strategy. It doesn’t matter if you’re a service-based website, a growing retail business—or if you sell nothing at all. Every company is a digital experience company. Everyone needs to care about user research, from the individual executives across each department, all the way up to C-suite. It's fundamental to business survival. — [Updated on 2021-03-26 17:26:05](https://hyp.is/6DRpnI4MEeuKCMNHwTXTuA/www.userzoom.com/ux-library/report-ux-360-demonstrating-digital-success/?&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=EBOK_2021_02_04_UX_360/) — Group: #Public
