## Page Notes
## Highlights
- Sometimes winning is surviving.Most apps from the early App Store-era that were hailed for their design are no longer with us (Path). Yet Paper is still here. And in much the same form as when it was first released having weathered the many tides of changing UI trends (flat design) and iOS updates. The same principles continued guiding it through new features, experiments, and even full rewrites. Every part replaced, yet its soul intact. — [Updated on 2022-06-20 15:12:37](https://hyp.is/-2sKePBfEeyVIjsg7PkHEA/www.andy.works/words/paper-at-10) — Group: #Public
