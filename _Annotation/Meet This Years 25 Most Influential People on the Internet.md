## Highlights
- il Miquela has all the makings of an Instagram ingenue, from the effortless good looks to the philosophy-lite selfie captions (“You can be not okay and still be strong”). The glaring difference? The self-described artist—also known as Miquela Sousa—isn’t actually real; she’s a virtual avatar whose origins and purpose are mysterious. (She was built by an entity called Cain Intelligence—which may or may not exist—before being taken over by Brud, an L.A.-based computer-software firm, but she is no longer managed by Brud, a publicist says.) That hasn’t stopped the fashion world from embracing Miquela as a style icon. In February, Prada tapped her to help promote its new line of animated GIFs on Instagram. In March, she appeared in an issue of V Magazine, which dubbed her the “face of new-age logomania” (a reference to the gear she “wears,” from brands such as Balenciaga and Kenzo). And in June, she was featured in Wonderland’s summer issue—alongside actual celebrities like Migos and Amandla Stenberg. —Melissa Chan — [Updated on 2022-05-16 13:34:27](https://hyp.is/eG_ekNTREeyrrBvZ281_4A/time.com/5324130/most-influential-internet/) — Group: #Public
