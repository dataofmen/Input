- Recommended Reading The following books and websites are good references on how to design great charts. These books provided inspiration for this article series. Better Data Visualizations: A Guide for Scholars, Researchers, and Wonks by Jonathan Schwabish Schwabish’s book provides concrete guidance on when to use each type of chart (from basic charts like bar charts to more obscure options like violin charts and treemaps). He provides detailed advice on how to design each type. Schwabish’s book is written in plain language and should be approachable for all experience levels. Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic Nussbaumer Knaflic’s guide advocates for applying a design mindset to your data visualizations — starting from a clear understanding of your audience and your objective. The book goes beyond data visualization to consider the story you build around your data. The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward R. Tufte As a data visualization classic, Tufte’s book elevates this “boring” topic to an art form. Tufte assembles a diverse collection of data-visualization examples from a variety of fields, countries, and centuries. While this book may be less practical and applicable than the others listed here, I highly recommend it to anyone deeply interested in data visualization. — [Updated on 2022-02-11 12:45:42](https://hyp.is/Fe5JGortEey1udtDnqRTCw/www.nngroup.com/articles/choosing-chart-types/) — Group: #Public
