# Causal vs Excel

## The 3 core concepts

### 1\. Variables, not cells

Causal's **variables** are like spreadsheet cells with superpowers. Because variables have names, your formulas are instantly readable:   
  
**Profit = Revenue - Costs**, not **D5 = $D$2 - D4**.

When forecasting, instead of making dozens of columns with duplicated formulas, Causal lets you write a single formula that gets automatically applied over time.

### 2\. Interactive presentations

When you're done with an Excel model, you'll probably copy some charts and tables in a slide deck. If your team are savvy, you might send them the file with a 'presentation' tab showing the main results.

Causal automatically turns your model into an **interactive dashboard** — share a link with your team, and they can see all your visuals and play with your model assumptions, with no chance of breaking anything.

### 3\. Data Integrations

In Excel, you'll need to spend hours importing/exporting CSVs, manually getting them into the right format, and then connecting them to your model using formulas.  
  
Causal has live data integrations with 100s of data sources including **Xero**, **QuickBooks**, **NetSuite**, and even **Google Sheets**. Once you're connected, Causal can automatically performs [forecast vs actuals analyses](https://app.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e983de89faf429c0810c74ab3&id=c35f51b8cb&e=0a4b8b11a3) so you can see how accurate your model is.
