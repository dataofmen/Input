Ray Dalio's interview with Tucker Carlson just went viral.

And he's NOT just talking about market predictions.

Instead, he exposed a dark truth most Americans don't want to admit.

Here are his 7 shocking claims about 'America's new Civil War': üßµ

For 2 hours, Tucker sat stunned as Dalio methodically broke down the forces tearing America apart.

Not with opinions or politics.

But with cold, hard data that proves we're already in a civil war.

Here's what he revealed:

1\. America's New Civil War

We're already in it, but not with guns (yet).

Dalio warns: "There are irreconcilable differences that each side is willing to fight for."

The polarization is the worst since 1900 - with the lowest cross-party cooperation in history.

2\. The 60% Crisis

A shocking statistic that explains everything:

60% of Americans have below a 6th grade reading level.

Only 3 million people (out of 330+ million) are driving all technological innovation.

This education gap is creating an unprecedented wealth divide.

3\. The AI Time Warp

"We're going to go through a time warp in the next 5 years." Current AI systems already match PhD-level knowledge across ALL fields.

This capability compounds daily, revolutionizing:

‚Ä¢ Economic policy

‚Ä¢ Military strategy

‚Ä¢ Social systems

‚Ä¢ Healthcare

4\. The China Reality Check

Dalio drops a bomb:

The US will never catch up to China in manufacturing "in our lifetimes."

China controls 33% of global manufacturing - more than US, Europe & Japan combined.

They're dominating in Robotics, Chip production, AND AI application...
