When it comes to choosing this my #1 advice is: Don’t be a hero. I've seen a lot of people who are eager to get crazy and creative in stacking up the lego blocks of the neural net toolbox in various exotic architectures that make sense to them. Resist this temptation strongly in the early stages of your project. | always advise people to simply find the most related paper and copy paste their simplest architecture that achieves good performance. E.g. if you are classifying images don't be a hero and just copy paste a ResNet-50 for your first run.
