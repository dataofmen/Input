Cut Sheet

A cut sheet is a general term for a few pages of specifications, instructions, dimensions, etc. that apply to a certain technical product or product line, generally shipped with the product. It is my understanding that they are called such because they are frequently pages which are "cut" from the company catalog. 

Cut sheets are generally specific enough to convey any information that the customer might need to install or use the product.
