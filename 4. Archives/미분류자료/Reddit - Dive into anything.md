Hi Reddit, it's been a while since I showcased my setup. The previous one got a lot of attentions and tons of questions came thorugh. My setups are simple and targetted so you won't see much of the fancy features like others post here. I'm a Senior Software Engineer and I use Obsidian mostly at work. This is so far the most functional yet beautiful setup I could come up with. Everything is tailored for speed and purpose.

Plus I created a video for newbies how to set it up my way if anyone is interested :)

There is a link to the configuration also in the description of the video, you can download and use it if you wish to. I showed how you can replace the config at the end of the video.
