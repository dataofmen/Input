Learn how to code a SaaS from 0 using AI.

I made this free course for beginners to build an internet startup:

1\. Learn the coding fundamentals

2\. Build a SaaS with a modern tech stack

3\. Code and design 10x faster with AI

(the video is 3 hours long, bookmark this)

"Learn the coding fundamentals" - is very important when building proper apps

I spent a month to understand how coding works while people want to build fully working apps with a single prompt

You need skills!

Yes! So later it's much easier to delegate to an AI

lol it's Juan, he's a student of CodeFast and Google decided to pick his testimonial photo instead of the default CodeFast logo

How different is this from CodeFast?

This video is a roadmap to learn to code, with all the crucial steps.

CodeFast goes much deeper (12hrs+) with step by step tutorials.

You also get a live instructor on Discord you can ask anything.
