What will happen in broader academia when clear scientific consensus is that AI-assisted education delivers better outcomes than 3.8M teachers currently do?

Already there. But it's clear you're trying to rebrand as a futurist not an arms dealer.

I started my career building VR headsets bro, I don't think my futurist credentials have ever been in doubt

How about you shut your mouth about education when you make weapons that have undoubtedly killed kids, Mr. 2.1 children.

How many children are manning Russian tanks, retard?

Hypocrites who think their finger painting makes them more qualified than people actually working against violent dictators are so common and so tiresome.

I think a human connection is important for the development of a child..

College & university could definitely use AI-assisted education though.. It could also cut the cost..

But I hope we don't see this for elementary schools though.

We won’t need as many transvestite, non-binary, pedophile ‘teachers’ anymore.

(Prolly won’t need the teachers unions either…)
