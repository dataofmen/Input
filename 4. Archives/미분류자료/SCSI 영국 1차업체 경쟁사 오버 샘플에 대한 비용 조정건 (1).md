SCSI 영국 1차업체 경쟁사 오버 샘플에 대한 비용 조정건 (1)


### 실사업체에 아래와 같이 메일 보냈음
Dear All,

This is regarding the expenses for the fieldwork on SCSI project.

The issue is the following;
1. You had problem completing the non-list samples for the competitors.

2. It was a very serious situation for us since we had to finish the FW on time and asked you what you can do to solve this delay.

3. Since you did not give us a guarantee on finishing the samples, as a solution, we informed you that we will be contacting another firm to complete the non-list samples and you to only concentrate on the Samsung list samples and just asked for the finished data until that time.

4. You said that you have large team working on it, however on the speed that you were working, there was no way to finish the competitor samples. And you still did not give us firm assurance that you will finish it. 
   * The competitor sample size that was completed by then was DTV 41 / HHP 49 / REF 30 / TAB 33 only. (by July 26th)

5. By August 2nd, the number of competitor samples increased to DTV 91 / HHP 68 / REF 66 / TAB 54 however still 123 samples were not finished and even Samsung list samples were not finished. 

Due to the speed of the fieldwork, we had to finish competitor samples with another company which took us extra time and budget. However you still kept on working on it even though the fact that I informed you to only focus on working on Samsung list samples and we do not think it is our responsibility to take care of the additional competitors’ samples that you completed. 
Therefore, we have to say that you could only pay you for the samples that were completed by August 2nd.

I want to express appreciation for your work on this project however because of the delay and the process of the work, we are to inform you that this decision has been made. 
I hope you understand.

Thank you
Sincerely,
