## **Introduction**

Behavioral economics is entrenched in economics and psychology building upon a human-centered understanding that people have a “predictable” bounded rationality and rarely behave in mirroring the utility maximizes conventional economics theory would normally predict (Wang & Groene, 2020). This is what makes behavioral economics more human-focused than economics theory. A person’s decision-making can be influenced by a wide range of factors like motivation, skills, psychological, cognitive, emotional, social, and physical environments; creating opportunities for choice architecture to be another influence (Wang & Greene, 2020). By applying foundational theory from behavioral economics critical insights into decision-making processes can enhance user experience (UX) and service design. Ensuring that products and/or services not only account for predictable errors and decision-making tendencies but also create intuitive, user-centered solutions for everyday use. Designers with a strong understanding of behavioral science offer opportunities for improved digital strategies, more engaging optimized websites with higher conversion rates, and better engagement if done right.

As a person moves through their physical and/or digital environments each day they are confronted with an array of different choices and cues to help guide their decision-making (Thaler et al., 2012, p.429). Behavioral economics accounts for basic principles of human psychology that choice architecture can build upon to sway good or bad decisions. Even if a human being selects to not make a decision they are still making a decision in their created environment. A general good rule is to assume that everything matters when it comes to a person’s making decisions (Thaler et al., 2012). To help guide those decisions a person can be nudged towards a decision thanks to the concepts of choice architecture. Choice architecture has six tenants that influence and can nudge choices. Those six tenants are defaults, feedback, incentives, mapping, structuring, and predictable error.

## **Defaults**

People will often take the option that requires the least effort when faced with laziness, fear, and/or distraction (Thaler et al., 2012, p. 430). Defaults are the primary example of making no choice or a pre-selected choice that also lets a person make no choice. Defaults are powerful in a sense that people can stay in an automatic system and apply not much thought to what the decision outcome will be. Compared to the other tenants of choice architecture defaults are the path of least resistance. It is easy to create an experience that can gather a large number of people that simply automatically select intothe default option. Designing the right default circumstance to guide a person through a series of desired outcomes, happens more than most designers are aware of.

Defaults can create required choice, or mandated choice even with pre-selected options (Thaler et al., 2012). A person would have to be aware of the option and willingly choose to select no to be contacted. Required choice however can be a nuisance yet it offers freedom of choice compared to mandated choice (Thaler et al., 2012). An example of mandated choice would be someone being defaulted as an organ donor when they receive their driver’s license, increasing the number of donors over time. Another example is onboarding to a new brand that lets defaults act as a way to corral consumers into receiving marketing emails, mail pieces, to unwanted text messages by defaulting users into an opt-in for marketing communications. Compared to the required choice having to find where the opt-out of marketing communications is located in a user’s account. The longer it takes a user to find the opt-out the less it is a default choice. Even an unsubscribe hiding at the bottom of an email is a required choice to opt out of an experience, or marketing journey.

Neither of these examples should be complex choices, which is an excellent usage of defaults (Thaler et al., 2012). Defaults can be not feasible when choices are beyond simple yes or no options. Generally, a default should not make a person think much of what was selected. The decision maker should be able to continue through their journey of decision-making without much hesitation. Defaults generally have the least overlapping with the other tenants of choice architecture as defaults are the most simplistic of the six tenants.

## **Predictable Errors**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*cQcf_PcYMTWQwDqQzqmr2g.png)

Making mistakes is a part of everyday life for humans. Factoring in opportunities to rethink errors and forgiveness is a part of crafting a well-designed system, especially a good design system (Thaler et al., 2012). Predictable errors can be studied and reassessed to guide a user through their or the system mistakes, in a mindful fashion. Understanding a person’s mental models can help build guardrails, messaging, and other forms of error feedback that make the required action clear. When users have expectations met with clear requirements it helps create a satisfactory experience.

Compared to the other tenants of choice architecture predictable errors have the most overlapping with other tenants. Each tenant has the possibility of being a part of a human error or system error. Not giving feedback, lack of thoughtful mapping, no default selected, zero incentive to move forward, or a complex choice that needs to be made that has no influence yet loaded with possibles for confusion. Errors happen everywhere but with no awareness or acknowledge by the user the error can not be fixed. Even within design processes errors can made and overlooked, hence the term human error.

## **Feedback**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Z1gvahVxG_lYShFHcsiuvA.png)

A well-designed system lets a person know when they are successful at the task at hand and/or when they have made a mistake (Thaler, et, al., 2012). The overall feedback is an output from the system that reports back findings that something good or bad happened, followed by making the user aware of those findings (Saffer, 2010). Feedback mechanisms in UX design are essential for creating engaging and informative user experiences. Providing immediate and clear feedback helps users understand the consequences of their actions, reinforcing positive behavior and correcting mistakes. People also expected a system to validate their actions.

When users understand the consequences of their actions it aligns with choice architecture’s emphasis on transparency and guidance (Thaler et al., 2012). Feedback creates awareness and options to make decisions. Designing interfaces requires an understanding of feedback loops. Without error messaging letting users know their form is not yet complete, or a successful submit would just leave users with a lack of trust in your product or service. Feedback is an expectation, people need to feel confident in the validation of what has been done.

Compared to other tenants feedback is about letting a person course correct a problem or reinforce the success of a system to build transparency, and trust, among other emotions connected to the system. Feedback is also one of the most important tenants of choice architecture for building great experiences. Feedback can also be cross-pollinated with predictive errors to create a more empowering user experience. Or Feedback can be used with mapping or complex choices to help influence a user in their decision-making.

## **Mapping**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*baBwb1wFXusXPz5dDuG1FQ.png)

A good system of choice architecture helps people improve their selection of options that will make them better off (Thaler et al., 2012). Good mapping offers information in a digestible way that can be transformed into a numerical value. However, it is easier to suggest numerical values versus people actually comprehending a numerical value easily. Effective UX design involves presenting information in a way that is easily digestible and actionable.

Mapping, as a principle of choice architecture, can be enhanced by UX practices such as visual hierarchy, clear labeling, and interactive elements that simplify complex data, making it more accessible and useful for users (Wang & Groene, 2020). Plenty of industries are faced with issues of transforming information into comprehensible data. However some industries use this to their advantage like mortgage interest rates, credit cards with hidden fees, and buy-one-get-one-free tactics, these are all examples of how mapping can be used to nudge a person into purchasing an item they do not need.

Mapping tends to lean towards decision information that focuses on the presentation of information that would be relevant to making the decision (Wang & Groene, 2020). How numerical data is made visible and organized can guide someone to move forward in making a decision. Compared to the other tenants mapping is more holistic in creating an experience for a person to navigate through. All tenants can be experienced through mapping, like having a default numerical data set that influences users or providing feedback on an error state.

## **Structure Complex Choices**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*-_uzduxd_BmFlAcJ8_zBQQ.png)

A large variety of choices requires alternative strategies for making decisions (Thaler et al., 2012). Structure complex choices by far are the most likely of the six tenants to offer choice architects the opportunities to influence decision-making. Previous social science research has uncovered that when choices become more verbose with different dimensions, people tend to simplify their strategies for decision-making (Thaler et al., 2012). Complex choices need more thoughtfulness applied to influencing outcomes to help guide the user to a decision compared to other tenants.

Structuring complex choices in UX design involves breaking down options into manageable parts and providing guidance to navigate them. Techniques such as progressive disclosure, where information is revealed gradually, and interactive decision aids can help users make informed choices without feeling overwhelmed. These strategies align with choice architecture’s goal of facilitating decision-making in complex scenarios (Thaler et al., 2012). However, complex choices compared to other tenants can use a variety of strategies to lead people to a decision for better or worse.

Methods like collaborative filtering which is used in social media product ads can validate a decision. Collaborative filtering helps with cognitive load, comparing other alternative products, and search costs; making it easier to select a choice (Thaler et al., 2012). Complex choices also offer more opportunities compared to other tenants to educate decisions in the long run as complex choices need more time to think through and digest what the outcome will be, based on a person’s needs.

## **Incentives**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:328/1*4cL15PxhkyHF-fNljYwZBg.png)

Everyone loves an incentive when using a product. In general, people are more motivated as they get closer to obtaining the goal they are working towards; this is where incentives work best (Weinschenk, 2011). Incentives require some thought when it comes to choice architecture to create a good incentive. Those four questions are (Thaler et al., 2012, p.437):

- Who uses?
- Who chooses?
- Who pays?
- Who profits?

Understanding the outcomes of these four questions and who the user is will provide the creator of the choice architecture a better understanding of what that person’s motivations are; connecting the right incentive to the right person (Thaler et al., 2012). This does not mean that all actions taken need to be incentives, just the completion of the bigger task or goal the user is completing.

Incentives in user experience or service design aim to motivate user engagement by aligning rewards with users’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Reward systems need to entice a person’s deep-rooted drivers. Understanding users’ goals and designing incentives that resonate with their needs can drive behavior more effectively (Weinschenk, 2011). For example, if someone is trying to save energy on their nest heating system, a weekly email comparing them to other users would help incentivize them to lower their energy usage. Even better if that weekly email used gamification elements such as points, badges, or personalized rewards on a leaderboard that helps to drive user motivation and satisfaction. Compared to the other tenants incentives can be ego-driven, with a bit of salience to drive attention to the reward.

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, integrating user experience and service design principles with behavioral economics and choice architecture creates more effective and user-centered solutions. By understanding users’ needs, behaviors, and decision-making processes, designers can craft systems that not only guide choices effectively but also enhance overall satisfaction and engagement. The future of design lies in the continuous refinement of better understanding people cognitive processes, what their needs are, and empower people to make better choices. At the same time designers and choice architects most remain ethically grounded, understanding the power of a good nudge with the responsibility to support people in making informed, autonomous decisions.
