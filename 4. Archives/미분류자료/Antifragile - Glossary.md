Antifragile - Glossary


Triad: The triplet Antifragility, Robustness, Fragility.

Fundamental Asymmetry (also Seneca’s Asymmetry): When someone has more
upside than downside in a certain situation, he is antifragile and tends to gain from (a)
volatility, (b) randomness, (c) errors, (d) uncertainty, (e) stressors, (f) time. And the
reverse.

Procrustean bed: Procrustes got people to fit perfectly into his bed by cutting or
stretching their limbs. Corresponds to situations in which simplifications are not
simplifications.

Fragilista: Someone who causes fragility because he thinks he understands what’s
going on. Also usually lacks sense of humor. See Iatrogenics. Often Fragilistas
fragilize by depriving variability-loving systems of variability and error-loving
systems of errors. They tend to mistake organisms for machines and engineering
projects.

Lecturing-Birds-How-to-Fly Effect: Inverting the arrow of knowledge to read
academia → practice, or education → wealth, to make it look as though technology
owes more to institutional science than it actually does.

Touristification: The attempt to suck randomness out of life. Applies to soccer moms,
Washington civil servants, strategic planners, social engineers, “nudge” manipulators,
etc. Opposite: rational flâneur.

Rational flâneur (or just flâneur): Someone who, unlike a tourist, makes a decision
opportunistically at every step to revise his schedule (or his destination) so he can
imbibe things based on new information obtained. In research and entrepreneurship,
being a flâneur is called “looking for optionality.” A non-narrative approach to life.

Barbell Strategy: A dual strategy, a combination of two extremes, one safe and one
speculative, deemed more robust than a “monomodal” strategy; often a necessary
condition for antifragility. For instance, in biological systems, the equivalent of
marrying an accountant and having an occasional fling with a rock star; for a writer,
getting a stable sinecure and writing without the pressures of the market during spare
time. Even trial and error are a form of barbell.
Iatrogenics: Harm done by the healer, as when the doctor’s interventions do more
harm than good.
Generalized Iatrogenics: By extension, applies to the harmful side effects of actions
by policy makers and activities of academics.
Tantalized Class: An economic condition of making more than minimum wage and
wishing for more wealth. Workers, monks, hippies, some artists, and English
aristocrats escape it. The middle class tends to fall into it; so do Russian billionaires,
lobbyists, most bankers, and bureaucrats. Members are bribable provided they are
given an adequate narrative, mostly with the use of casuistry.
Black Swan Errors
Nonpredictive Approach: Building stuff in a manner immune to perturbations—
hence robust to changes in future outcomes.
Thalesian versus Aristotelian: The Thalesian focuses on exposure, payoff from
decision; the Aristotelian focuses on logic, the True-False distinction. For Fat
Tony, the problem is all about sucker-nonsucker, or risks and rewards. (Also see
nonlinearities, convexity effects.)
Conflation of Event and Exposure: Mistaking a function of a variable for the
variable itself.Naturalistic Risk Management: The belief that, when it comes to risk management,
Mother Nature has a much, much more significant track record than rationalistic
humans. It is imperfect, but much better.
Burden of evidence: The burden of evidence falls on those who disrupt the natural, or
those who propose via positiva policies.
Ludic Fallacy: Mistaking the well-posed problems of mathematics and laboratory
experiments for the ecologically complex real world. Includes mistaking the
randomness in casinos for that in real life.
Antifragile Tinkering, Bricolage: A certain class of trial and error, with small errors
being “the right” kind of mistakes. All equivalent to rational flâneur.
Hormesis: A bit of a harmful substance, or stressor, in the right dose or with the right
intensity, stimulates the organism and makes it better, stronger, healthier, and prepared
for a stronger dose the next exposure. (Think of bones and karate.)
Naive Interventionism: Intervention with disregard to iatrogenics. The preference,
even obligation, to “do something” over doing nothing. While this instinct can be
beneficial in emergency rooms or ancestral environments, it hurts in others in which
there is an “expert problem.”
Naive Rationalism: Thinking that the reasons for things are, by default, accessible to
university buildings. Also called the Soviet-Harvard illusion.
Turkey and Inverse Turkey : The turkey is fed by the butcher for a thousand days, and
every day the turkey pronounces with increased statistical confidence that the butcher
“will never hurt it”—until Thanksgiving, which brings a Black Swan revision of belief
for the turkey. The inverse turkey error is the mirror confusion, not seeing
opportunities—pronouncing that one has evidence that someone digging for gold or
searching for cures will “never find” anything.
Doxastic Commitment, or “Soul in the Game”: You must only believe predictions
and opinions by those who committed themselves to a certain belief, and had somethingto lose, in a way to pay a cost in being wrong.
Heuristics: Simple, practical, easy-to-apply rules of thumb that make life easy. These
are necessary (we do not have the mental power to absorb all information and tend to
be confused by details) but they can get us in trouble as we do not know we are using
them when forming judgments.
Opaque Heuristic: Routine performed by societies that does not seem to make sense
yet has been done for a long time and sticks for unknown reasons.
Dionysian: Opaque heuristic seemingly irrational, named after Dionysos (or Bacchus
for Romans), the god of wine and revelling. Is contrasted to the Apollonian, which
represents order.
Agency Problem: Situation in which the manager of a business is not the true owner,
so he follows a strategy that cosmetically seems to be sound, but in a hidden way
benefits him and makes him antifragile at the expense (fragility) of the true owners or
society. When he is right, he collects large benefits; when he is wrong, others pay the
price. Typically this problem leads to fragility, as it is easy to hide risks. It also affects
politicians and academics. A major source of fragility.
Hammurabi Risk Management: The idea that a builder has more knowledge than the
inspector and can hide risks in the foundations where they can be most invisible; the
remedy is to remove the incentive in favor of delayed risk.
Green Lumber Fallacy: Mistaking the source of important or even necessary
knowledge—the greenness of lumber—for another, less visible from the outside, less
tractable one. How theoreticians impute wrong weights to what one should know in a
certain business or, more generally, how many things we call “relevant knowledge”
aren’t so much so.
Skin in the Game / Captain and Ship Rule: Every captain goes down with every ship.
This removes the agency problem and the lack of doxastic commitment.
Empedocles’ Tile: A dog sleeps on the same tile because of a natural, biological,explainable or nonexplainable match, confirmed by long series of recurrent
frequentation. We may never know the reason, but the match is there. Example: why we
read books.
Cherry-picking: Selecting from the data what serves to prove one’s point and ignoring
disconfirming elements.
Ethical Problems as Transfers of Asymmetry (fragility): Someone steals
antifragility and optionality from others, getting the upside and sticking others with the
downside. “Others’ skin in the game.”
The Robert Rubin violation: Stolen optionality. Getting upside from a strategy
without downside for oneself, leaving the harm to society. Rubin got $120 million
in compensation from Citibank; taxpayers are retrospectively paying for his
errors.
The Alan Blinder problem: (1) Using privileges of office retrospectively at the
expense of citizens. (2) Violating moral rules while complying perfectly with the
law; confusion of ethical and legal. (3) The regulator’s incentive to make
complicated regulations in order to subsequently sell his “expertise” to the private
sector.
The Joseph Stiglitz problem: Lack of penalty from bad recommendation causing
harm to others. Mental cherry-picking, leading to contributing to the cause of a
crisis while being convinced of the opposite—and thinking he predicted it.
Applies to people with opinions without skin in the game.
Rational Optionality: Not being locked into a given program, so one can change his
mind as he goes along based on discovery or new information. Also applies to rational
flâneur.
Ethical Inversion: Fitting one’s ethics to actions (or profession) rather than the
reverse.Narrative Fallacy: Our need to fit a story, or pattern, to a series of connected or
disconnected facts. The statistical application is data mining.
Narrative Discipline: Discipline that consists of fitting a convincing and goodsounding story to the past. Opposed to experimental discipline. A great way to fool
people is to use statistics as part of the narrative, by ferreting out “good stories” from
the data thanks to cherry picking; in medicine, epidemiological studies tend to be
marred with the narrative fallacy, less so controlled experiments. Controlled
experiments are more rigorous, less subjected to cherry-picking.
Non-narrative action: Does not depend on a narrative for the action to be right—the
narrative is just there to motivate, entertain, or prompt action. See flâneur.
Robust Narrative: When the narrative does not produce opposite conclusions or
recommendations for action under change of assumption or environment. The narrative
is otherwise fragile. Similarly, a robust model or mathematical tool does not lead to
different policies when you change some parts of the model.
Subtractive Knowledge: You know what is wrong with more certainty than you know
anything else. An application of via negativa.
Via negativa: In theology and philosophy, the focus on what something is not, an
indirect definition. In action, it is a recipe for what to avoid, what not to do—
subtraction, not addition, say, in medicine.
Subtractive Prophecy: Predicting the future by removing what is fragile from it rather
than naively adding to it. An application of via negativa.
Lindy Effect: A technology, or anything nonperishable, increases in life expectancy
with every day of its life—unlike perishable items (such as humans, cats, dogs, and
tomatoes). So a book that has been a hundred years in print is likely to stay in print
another hundred years.
Neomania: A love of change for its own sake, a form of philistinism that does not
comply with the Lindy effect and understands fragility. Forecasts the future by adding,not subtracting.
Opacity: You do not see the barrel when someone is playing Russian roulette. More
generally, some things remain opaque to us, leading to illusions of understanding.
Mediocristan: A process dominated by the mediocre, with few extreme successes or
failures (say, income for a dentist). No single observation can meaningfully affect the
aggregate. Also called “thin-tailed,” or member of the Gaussian family of distributions.
Extremistan: A process where the total can be conceivably impacted by a single
observation (say, income for a writer). Also called “fat-tailed.” Includes the fractal, or
power-law, family of distributions.
Nonlinearities, Convexity Effects (smiles and frowns): Nonlinearities can be
concave or convex, or a mix of both. The term convexity effects is an extension and
generalization of the fundamental asymmetry. The technical name for fragility is
negative convexity effects and for antifragility is positive convexity effects. Convex is
good (a smiley), concave is bad (a frowny).
Philosopher’s Stone, also called Convexity Bias (very technical): The exact measure
of benefits derived from nonlinearity or optionality (or, even more technically, the
difference between x and a convex function of x). For instance, such bias can quantify
the health benefits of variable intensity of pulmonary ventilation over steady pressure,
or compute the gains from infrequent feeding. The Procrustean bed from the neglec
