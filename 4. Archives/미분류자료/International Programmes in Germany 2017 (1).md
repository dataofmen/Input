Course content	In the PhD programme in Marketing students learn to combine advanced quantitative and analytical skills with marketing theory, and to apply these to real-world challenges posed by industry partners, with the goal of developing marketing theory and practice to a higher level. The PhD programme in Marketing offers a two-year cycle of doctoral-level courses developed to convey a rigorous methodological and theoretical framework across the areas of marketing, management, microeconomics, econometrics, mathematical methods, and the normative foundations of business administration. In the second year, students can select from a variety of second-year field courses designed to expose students to the research frontier in their fields of specialisation and to facilitate students' own research. Past graduates have joined companies such as BASF, Commerzbank, GfK, or McKinsey. Academic placements have included Frankfurt School of Finance, London Business School, Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, University of Technology Sydney, and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
