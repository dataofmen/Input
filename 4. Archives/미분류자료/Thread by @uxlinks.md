Excellent Cheatsheet to Help You Understand Your Customers in Your Next Design Project 🙌

FREE Cheatsheet attached 🔖

Four levels of customer understanding

Level 1

What they say

Don't rely too much on CRM data, surveys, or polls. It may look like data, but it's often just opinions.

Level 2

What they think or feel

Good surveys and buyer interviews can help you understand this by looking at customer expectations and experiences.

Level 3

What they do

To influence what customers buy, you need to understand their actions. Use open ended questioning, task analysis, and behavioural analytics.

Level 4

Why they

To get deep understanding, find out why customers act the way they do. This can be done through detailed interviews, psychological analysis, and behavioural observation.
