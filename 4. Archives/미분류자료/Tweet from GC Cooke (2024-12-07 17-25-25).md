## "Cognifying"

AI will be embedded in EVERYTHING.

The numbers are staggering: The AI market will explode from $136B to $1.8T by 2030.

That's faster growth than the internet in the 90s.

And it's already transforming our world:

Imagine walking into a hospital where AI has already diagnosed your condition from your vitals.

Even your toaster and washing machine will have human level of intelligence

Meanwhile, smart factories are optimizing themselves, and farms are adjusting water levels by the minute.


## "Flowing"

The ownership economy is dying. Fast.

In 2023, 1.1B people subscribed to streaming services. By 2028 he predicts a 45% rise.

But entertainment is just the beginning. The subscription revolution is coming for everything you own.

Think about it: Why own a car when you can summon any vehicle you need, instantly?

Why buy furniture when your home automatically swaps pieces based on the season?

The sharing economy will hit $335B by 2025. Old business models are crumbling.


## "Remixing"

Something wild is happening in creation.

The generative AI market will surge from $10.6B to $208.8B by 2030.

Why? Because everything - code, content, products - is becoming raw material for something new.

Developers are building million-dollar apps from existing code blocks.

Musicians are creating hit songs by blending genres in ways never imagined.

The next breakthrough won't be entirely new - it'll be a clever remix of what already exists.


## "Interacting"

Virtual reality is about to swallow the real world whole.

The AR/VR market will explode to $454.73B by 2030.

But forget gaming - this technology is revolutionizing how we work, learn, and live.

Surgeons are operating on patients from across the globe.

Engineers are designing rockets in shared 3D spaces.

And somewhere, a student is dissecting a virtual human heart while their classmates watch from five different continents.


## "Tracking"

We're entering an age where everything becomes measurable.

The Internet of Things will grow from $478B to $2.4T by 2029.

Every object, every process, every movement will have a digital pulse.

Cities are becoming living organisms, adjusting traffic flows in real-time.

Buildings are learning to slash their energy use.

And your health?

It's being monitored and optimized 24/7, catching diseases before they start.


Kelly's predictions aren't abstract theories - they're backed by massive market shifts:

• AI growing to $1.8T
• IoT reaching $2.4T
• AR/VR hitting $454B

The question isn't if these changes will happen, it's how you'll position yourself to benefit.
