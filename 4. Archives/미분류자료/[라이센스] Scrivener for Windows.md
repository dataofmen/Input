REGISTRATION INFORMATION

We hope you enjoy using Scrivener. The registration details above allow you to unlock the trial version of Scrivener so that it becomes the full version.

To start using the full version of Scrivener, follow these instructions:

INSTALLING

Scrivener is download-only, so if you have not done so already, you will need to download and install the trial version:

1) Download the trial version by clicking on the download link on the product page:

http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php

2) When prompted, choose to save the file to disk (it is usually better to save it than to run it directly). If you are not prompted, your browser will most likely save the file to your Downloads folder.

3) In Windows Explorer, navigate to the location you chose to save the file in step (2) and then double-click on the file entitled "Scrivener-installer.exe".

4) Follow the on-screen instructions.

5) Once you have followed these instructions, launch Scrivener via the Windows Start menu. (Scrivener will not start automatically after install.) You can now delete the Scrivener-installer.exe file if you so wish.

ENTERING YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION

When the trial launches and you get to the nag box that tells you how much of the trial period you have remaining, click on the "Enter Licence..." button and enter the user name and serial number exactly as they appear above. (Note that the serial number is tied to the user name, so it is a good idea to copy and paste both, being careful not to copy any extra blank spaces at the end of the serial number.) Alternatively, while running Scrivener, you can select "Registration..." from the Help menu. Entering your licence information into the trial version turns it into the full version (that is, removes the time limit).

GETTING UP AND RUNNING

We strongly recommend that you go through the interactive tutorial project (available from the Help menu inside Scrivener or from the "Getting Started" section of the project template chooser panel) to get up and running and learn Scrivener's major features before starting your own projects. The interactive tutorial is by far the fastest and best way to get to grips with how Scrivener works.

This order confirmation contains both your receipt and registration details, so please be sure to save this information and keep it somewhere safe. (Please note that because we are a small shareware company, we are unable to provide printed receipts via the post.)

Happy writing!
