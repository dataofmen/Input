Skip the coding bootcamp! With Bolt and Expo you can create mobile applications simply by describing the app you want to build.

![Get your idea to the app store without writing code](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/siias52v/production/5e51084a6e219fe05b89d0aedf00509a9e7d36cc-2400x1350.png?auto=format&fit=max&q=75&w=1200)

As of today, [Bolt.new allows you to build iOS and Android apps](https://bolt.new/~/bolt-expo) without writing any code. You can literally go from *idea to App Store* simply by describing what you want in everyday language.

In the video below, I test out the integration by building a portfolio app to showcase some of my open-source work. The result is stunning‚ÄîI was able to create a clean, professional-looking portfolio application for web, iOS, and Android without writing a single line of code. If you‚Äôre curious, here‚Äôs the live demo: [https://beto-fyi.expo.app](https://beto-fyi.expo.app/).

## What is Bolt?

](https://expo.dev/blog/#what-is-bolt)

Bolt, from StackBlitz, is an AI-powered web development agent that allows you to build web, iOS, and Android apps directly from your browser.

With the new Expo integration, developers‚Äîand even non-technical users‚Äîcan generate mobile app code and preview it in real time, regardless of their platform (Windows, Mac, etc.). As they provide feedback, the AI agent refines their vision, allowing them to watch their app take shape in real time.

This streamlined development process is incredibly useful for building an MVP or brainstorming ideas with teammates. For freelance developers, it‚Äôs also a great way to impress potential clients.

And this is just the beginning‚Ä¶

## How to get started with Bolt and Expo?

](https://expo.dev/blog/#how-to-get-started-with-bolt-and-expo)

Getting started couldn‚Äôt be simpler. Just go to [Bolt.new](http://bolt.new/) and choose the [Expo starter template](https://bolt.new/~/bolt-expo). Then, prompt the tool to start building your app by simply describing what you want.

Bolt includes a **‚Äúprompt enhancer‚Äù** that you should absolutely use. If you have the time, it‚Äôs helpful to think through the following and include these details in your prompt:

- **What general qualities should the app have?** Should it be professional or playful? Bold or subtle?
- **What is the basic layout?** Consider the screens you want to include, such as a home page, an about page, a product page, or a pricing page.
- **Should the app pull specific data from anywhere?** You can ask Bolt to use particular images or pull data from specific public sources.
- **Do you have reference materials?** You can attach images and Figma assets in your prompt and ask Bolt to use them as references.

Once you submit your prompt, Bolt‚Äôs AI agent will start coding your app. Within seconds, you‚Äôll have an MVP. It feels like magic‚Äîmaybe someday this will feel normal, but today, it still feels like magic.

For more details on deploying your app, please visit the Bolt documentation.

## What‚Äôs next for Bolt and Expo?

](https://expo.dev/blog/#whats-next-for-bolt-and-expo)

Today, you can build an app with Bolt and Expo‚Äîwhich is fantastic. The next step in this integration is bringing **Expo Application Services (EAS)** into Bolt. Once that happens, you‚Äôll be able to build, submit, and deploy your apps in a single seamless motion.

Personally, I‚Äôm super excited about this integration and hope it **empowers** both developers and non-technical users to start building awesome multiplatform apps‚Äîand even dive deeper as their requirements grow. It‚Äôs also exciting to see more and more companies, like StackBlitz, adopting Expo as the framework for universal development.

Don‚Äôt forget to share what you build on X and tag **@expo** or me **@betomoedano**!

Happy AI coding! ü§ì

p.s. Join the livestream on February 25th to see a live demo of the integration:
