Wall Street's biggest nightmare just came true:

Elon proved that 80% of corporate jobs are unnecessary.

Not because humans are lazy.

But because he discovered a dark truth about modern companies that no CEO wants to admit:

When Elon bought Twitter for $44B in 2022, the world called him crazy.

The platform was bloated, inefficient, and bleeding money.

But Twitter would become more than a social network.

Modern organizations are built for a pre-AI world.

They're weighed down by layers of management, redundant approvals, and manual tasks that could be automated.

Elon's strategy was to strip it all away and rebuild from scratch.

The execution was masterful:
