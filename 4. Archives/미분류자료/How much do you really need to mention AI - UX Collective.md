I first found [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/) four years ago when I was [doing some user research](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/user-interviews-101-567acc1d477f).

At the time, it was a **life saver;** it was easy to set up and it combined recording, transcribing and storing the interviews.

There was just one problem.

The transcripts were *rubbish*.

With any sign of an accent, the transcript accuracy went down hill. What’s more, they just didn’t really make sense a lot of the time.

Meaning they took *hours* to edit.

As a result, I slowly forgot about the tool. It didn’t make its way into my daily routine.

That was until 8 months ago when I re-tried it.

Fast forward a few months, and I fished out $240 for their annual subscription.

Otter is in all my calls. I use it daily; like another brain.

The transcripts are still not 100% there — but I use it for other things now.
