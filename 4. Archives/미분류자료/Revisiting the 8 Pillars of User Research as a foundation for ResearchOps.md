“[The Eight Pillars of User Research](https://medium.com/researchops-community/the-eight-pillars-of-user-research-1bcd2820d75a?sk=0713e610770b68b0cfabd509fda16786)” is one of the defining articles of ResearchOps with around 60,000 views at the time of writing this.

As Jake Burghardt, UX author and ResearchOps editor, states: *“The 8 pillars have provided a framework for understanding the breadth of topics that we want to cover with ResearchOps-Community articles. It sets a scope.”*

While this article will summarise the eight pillars we recommend that you [read Emma’s original](https://medium.com/researchops-community/the-eight-pillars-of-user-research-1bcd2820d75a?sk=0713e610770b68b0cfabd509fda16786) (which was based on input from Brigette Metzler, Emma Boulton, Holly Cole and Tomomi Sasaki) to get an in-depth understanding.

## The ResearchOps 8 Pillars of User Research

The [global ResearchOps community](https://researchops.community/) researched what are the main areas that user research operates within. As Discovery is a user research-led process it made sense to frame the questions within a user research framework.

The Eight Pillars that emerged are:

1.  **Environment** — Why does research happen? Who is engaged?
2.  **Scope** — How and when does research happen? What methods?
3.  **Recruitment and Admin** — How do I manage all the project and participant admin?
4.  **Data and Knowledge Management** — What happens to the findings, data and insights?
5.  **People** — Who is responsible for carrying out research?
6.  **Organisational context** — What are the internal and external constraints?
7.  **Governance** — What are the legal and ethical considerations?
8.  **Tools and infrastructure** — What systems and tools do I need for my projects?

## How the 8 pillars have been used

We put out an appeal on the [ResarchOps Slack](https://researchops.community/community/) (join us if you haven’t already) while [Emma posted on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7115320438515228672/) to find out what impact the article had.

We got dozens of responses on how it served as guidance for user researchers and teams in various industries looking to establish or formalise their research operations functions.

The 8 pillars framework has helped them prioritise what needs to be done, advocate for dedicated roles, and create a solid foundation to build upon.

## The 8 Pillars as a way to get started

From prioritising efforts to getting buy-in for new roles, the 8 pillars served as their guiding map:

> Where to start? What needs doing? What am I missing??? The pillars immediately gave me a head start on all of these questions.

— Cyril Rebetez, Games Industry User Researcher

> I used it with our team to help establish the ReOps function at UKHSA. It was invaluable as a foundation to start building upon.

— Dr Salma Patel, Lead User Research Consultant

> As a researcher of one joining a company which previously had no researchers, I’ve used the 8 pillars of researcher as a tool to conceptualise research practice.

Megan St Andrew, UX Researcher at Sourcegraph

> It was my number one resource in my learning folder.

Clara Parada, User Researcher and Learning Designer

From the original article: Help researchers focus on the research

## The 8 pillars as a way to talk about user research and ResearchOps

> I have used and heavily quoted the Eight pillars of User Research while I talk about the work and Impact of Research Ops in our organisation. It is a tangible map for “behind the curtain” contributors like us to see where we fit and how are we making things move.

— Shivanjali Mishra, User Researcher

## The 8 pillars as a way to drive change

> I’ve used the 8 pillars as a lens for research and change management within the company I work for. It helps me decide where I need to prioritise my efforts.

— Clara Kuo, UX Research Manager

> In 2019/2020, we used this on my team at Red Hat to push for the formalisation of a ReOps position on the team. Having such a formal and complete artefact certainly helped us to land the dedicated role on the team for a ReOps person.

— Carl Pearsonm, Quantitative UX Researcher, Reddit

> I used it to define priorities of what needed to be done for my team. One pivotal resource that guided my approach was the “8 Pillars of User Research”.

— Anja Maerz, Head of User Research and Customer Support, StudySmarter
