## Highlights
* When profiling your audience
* Quality vs quantity: when do you use each?
* However, these trends will likely fail to deliver unanimous answers, and important decisions shouldn’t be based on this kind of data, as the volume is simply too small.
* These wider surveys (and online tasks) can confirm the insights obtained previously and ensure this data is truly representative.
* When face-to-face sessions are not possible
* The importance of anonymity in research
