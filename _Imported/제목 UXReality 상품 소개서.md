Automated behavioral insights for UX/UI testing on mobile devices

Fast, easy, insightful – just three of the things we know you'll love about the **automated UXReality methodology.**

This methodology is a unique combination of standard User Experience (UX) / User Interface (UI) studies and nonconscious measurements obtained through online neuro-tools.

At the heart of the UXReality methodology is a task-based approach for testing digital products (mobile websites, apps, prototypes). Testers are given a task e.g., to order product X or reserve a flight ticket for a family of 3 to the city X on specific dates. Their experience is then evaluated using a short preset survey. While performing the task, the user’s mobile device camera tracks visual attention through eye-tracking and emotional response through facial coding. the user’s visual attention You’ll also be able to see all the scrolls and clicks, and how the user interacted with the content.

The main advantage is an automated analysis

UXReality methodology is completely automated so everything is done for you, from set up to processing, analysis, and results. Behavioral and survey data is processed and displayed automatically on the dashboard using charts, video recordings, basic analytics, and answers to open-ended questions.

Just run the project and get fast, automated insights on how awesome your product is. The analysis will even show you where improvements can be made.

**Engagement** - the metrics reveal how a user behaves while completing a task:

* Visual attention (based on eye-tracking data) shows how attentively or superficially the content is consumed,
