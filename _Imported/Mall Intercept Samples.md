A. Background
Mall intercept surveys are widely used and (theoretically) able to reach a large segment of the population.

B. Pluses And Minuses
The good things about mall samples are:
Experimental control.
Ability to see things.
Availability of kitchens, etc.
Cost.

The bad things are:
Not necessarily even representative of the areas they're in.
Demographically skewed samples. (Young, female, suburban, middle-income, frequent shoppers).
Limited to metropolitan areas.

According to an article by Seymour Sudman, 1 to achieve a very good sample via the mall intercept method. However, this is what you have to do.
Randomly select states or regions.
Randomly select cities within region.
Randomly select malls within cities.
Post interviewers at randomly selected mall entrances.
Interview all days and all times mall open.
Count traffic so interviews are proportional to traffic based on day of week and time of day.
Determine frequency of mall shopping and weight sample so that frequent shoppers not over-represented.
