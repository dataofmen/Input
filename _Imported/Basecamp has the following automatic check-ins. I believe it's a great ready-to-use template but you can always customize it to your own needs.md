•	Automatic Daily - 'What did you work on today?' every workday at 16:30. They use Basecamp, but you also have some wonderful bots for Slack do the same. Additionally, the write-ups are shared with everyone in the company so that anyone can comment on anyone else's post.
 
•	Automatic Weekly - 'What will you be working on this week?' every Monday morning.
 
•	Automatic occasionally - Social questions like 'What books are you reading?' or 'Anything inspire you lately?'. These questions are optional though and are primarily geared towards helping people share something they love, with everyone else.
 
•	Heartbeats - Summary of the last 6-weeks of work written by the lead of the group.
 
•	Kickoffs - At the same frequency as Heartbeats, Kickoffs project the team's plans.
 
•	Company-wide announcements - Whenever relevant e.g. major change in a policy.
