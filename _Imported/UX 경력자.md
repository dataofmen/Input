# UX 경력자 

# Summary

I design, code & analyze digital user experiences without forgetting of business & marketing challenges. Last 7 years I have worked with startups, agencies & small business to improve their digital potential around the world. I’ve increased 200%+ user activities in all past huge projects. Was lucky to work with great projects that raised $1.5M+ early investments in total. Exploring new & creating the value is my primary goal. Also I’m fan of Figma, Sketch, Vectors, Apple and Invision products. Interesting in tech, marketing, machine Learning, AI.
